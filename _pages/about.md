I am a postdoctoral resercher in [CMLab AIMM group](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) at National Taiwan University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/). Before my postdoctoral career, I serve as a research assistant in [IIS CVML Lab](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~liutyng/index.html) at Academia Sinica and obtain my Ph.D. degree in  Computer Science and Information Engineering at NTU, advised by Dr. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/index_en.html) and Prof. [Chiou-Shann Fuh](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~fuh/). My research topics cover computer vision and machine learning. I am most interested in exploring the latest research and novel techniques to develop an appropriate solution for the real world.
