I am a research assistant in [IIS CVML Lab](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~liutyng/index.html) at Academia Sinica. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in  Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU), advised by Dr. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/index_en.html) and Prof. [Chiou-Shann Fuh](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~fuh/). Before joining Academia Sinica, I graduated with an MS degree from the Institute of Applied Mathematical Sciences at NTU. My research topics cover computer vision and machine learning. I am most interested in exploring the latest research and novel techniques to develop an appropriate solution for the real world. Specifically, I am focusing on designing image-based and video-based anomaly detection architectures for the spatial domain and temporal modality, respectively.
