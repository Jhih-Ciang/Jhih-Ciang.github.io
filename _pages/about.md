I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [CMLab AIMM group](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) at National Taiwan University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/). Before my postdoctoral career, I was a research assistant at Academia Sinica and obtained my Ph.D. at NTU, advised by Dr. Tyng-Luh Liu and Prof. Chiou-Shann Fuh. My research topics cover computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
