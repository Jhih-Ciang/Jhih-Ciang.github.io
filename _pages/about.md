I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, NTNU. Prior to this role, I served as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [CMLab AIMM group](https://aimm.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/index.html) at National Taiwan University (NTU) under the mentorship of Prof. [Wen-Huang Cheng](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~wenhuang/). Additionally, I have gained valuable experience as a Research Assistant at Academia Sinica and earned my Ph.D. from NTU.

My research interests span computer vision, machine learning, multimedia, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on developing innovative approaches for real-world applications. I am passionate about mentoring highly self-motivated students and fostering collaborative research. If you are interested in collaboration or research opportunities, feel free to reach out.
