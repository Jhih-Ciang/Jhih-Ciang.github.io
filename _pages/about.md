I am a research assistant in [IIS CVML Lab](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~liutyng/index.html) at Academia Sinica. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in  Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU), advised by Dr. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/index_en.html) and Prof. [Chiou-Shann Fuh](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~fuh/). Before joining Academia Sinica, I graduated with an MS  from the Institute of Applied Mathematical Sciences at NTU.  My research topics cover computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition. More recently, I have tackled various types of anomaly detection.
